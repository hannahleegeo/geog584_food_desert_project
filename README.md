# Potential destinations from OpenStreetMap:

Source: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features#Shop

The wiki for OpenStreetMap lists numerous different types of map features.  I think the ones we should focus on are under Shop -> Food, beverages. (See link above)

A preliminary list for shop types (we can add or remove types based on group discussion):
supermarket, bakery, butcher, cheese, dairy, greengrocer, health_food, pasta, seafood, tea, water

Another type of destination we might want to include is Food Banks, organizations that provide food for those who struggle to afford it.
amenity=social_facility + social_facility=food_bank

Can find under Amenity -> Healthcare in the wiki link above
